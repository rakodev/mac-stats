# App Icon Creation Guide

Since we can't include actual image files in this text-based setup, here's how to create and add an app icon:

## Creating the App Icon

1. **Design Requirements:**
   - Create a 1024x1024 pixel PNG image
   - Simple, clean design that works at small sizes
   - Consider a CPU/chart/stats-related icon
   - Use Apple's macOS design guidelines

2. **Suggested Design Elements:**
   - CPU chip icon with activity indicators
   - Bar chart or line graph
   - System monitor-style visualization
   - Memory chip or RAM icon
   - Combination of CPU + Memory symbols

3. **Icon Generation:**
   - Use tools like Icon Set Creator, Preview, or online generators
   - Generate all required sizes (16x16 to 1024x1024)
   - Export as PNG with transparent background

## Adding to Project

1. **Replace placeholder icons:**
   - Open `MacStats/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
   - Replace placeholder images with your generated icons
   - Ensure proper naming convention

2. **Icon sizes needed:**
   - 16x16 (1x and 2x)
   - 32x32 (1x and 2x)
   - 128x128 (1x and 2x)
   - 256x256 (1x and 2x)
   - 512x512 (1x and 2x)

3. **Update Contents.json if needed**

## Alternative: Using SF Symbols

For a quick solution, the app currently uses SF Symbols in the interface:
- `chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis` for main icon
- `cpu` for CPU representation
- `memorychip` for memory representation

These work well for the menu bar display and can be used until custom icons are created.
